Baycombe is a village on the North Devon coast that is so isolated
from civilisation that even at the height of the summer holiday season
it is neglected by the rush of lean and plump, tall and short, papas,
mammas, and infants. Consequently, there was some sort of excuse for a
man who had taken up his dwelling there falling into the monotony of
regular habits—even for a man who had only lived there for three
days—even (let the worst be known) for a man so unconventional as
Simon Templar.
